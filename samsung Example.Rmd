## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Load dataset from specified path
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/nimat/Documents/Analysis Data/Final Project/Final_Project/Final_Project/forecast.csv")

# Make sure 'Quarter' is treated as a categorical variable in correct order
data$Quarter <- factor(data$Quarter, levels = data$Quarter)

head(data)

# Load necessary package
library(ggplot2)

# Generate comparison plot
ggplot(data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Quarter, y = True_Forecast, color = "True Forecast"), size = 4) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Quarter, y = Wrong_Forecast, color = "Wrong Forecast"), size = 4) +

  labs(
    title = "Samsung Forecast Comparison (True vs Wrong)",
    x = "Quarter",
