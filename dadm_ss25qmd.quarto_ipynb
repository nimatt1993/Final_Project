        "The presentation will take place during the lecture period, with the exact dates set by the lecturer. Each presentation lasts a minimum of 10 minutes per student. Additionally, students should produce a handout outlining the key points of your presentation and the literature on which it is based. The handout should provide additional information and resources beyond what is covered in the presentation. In other words, the handout should complement the presentation. The length of the handout should be between 3 and 5 pages of text. \n",

One of your key challenges is to identify the most important elements of your topic and present them in a manner that can be communicated and understood within the allocated time.

Both your handout and presentation should be available online on the day of your presentation. Ensure the HTML file is a standalone website (HTML), and also provide a PDF version of your handout and presentation. The PDF of your handout should be formatted for A4 paper. For guidance on creating a standalone HTML file, refer to [Quarto HTML Publishing](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-publishing.html#standalone-html). Publish both the website and handout on GitHub, sharing the URLs with the audience for access during your presentation. Additionally, please submit at least the following files on ILIAS: \n",
